  <h1>Udacity Notes for Stage 0</h1>

<p></p>Here is a summary of some of the things I've learned so far.</p>

<p><em><b>HTML</b></em>
  <br>Stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, and is the language which the internet browser reads and translates into a web document. </p>

<p><em><b> Tags and Elements</b></em>
  <br> A tag specifies how the browser should interpret a particular peice of information. In marking this information for a specific treatment, tags create <em>elements</em>. The <em>italized</em> text here is an element. Elements can be either 'in-line'
  or 'block'. What does this mean? A 'block' element creates an invisible box around the element. Hmmm..</p>
<em><b>What is an 'anchor'?</b></em>
<br> At this stage, I have no idea. They seem interesting and probably fairly foundation. My brain, as usual, remains pretty uninterested in everything that happened yesterday, including all the stuff I spent a hard time trying to <b>memorize.</b> So far
I'm doing OK with <b>bolding stuff</b>, <em>italicizing stuff</em> and
<br>
<br>putting in line breaks.
<p>That'll do for now!</p>
